# Programmation_Reseau_Systeme-TCP_over_UDP

The aim of this project was to understand as much as posible all the mechanisms of TCP by rebuilding it over UDP. 
The project consists in creating a client-server achitecture and more precisely a server that enables you to download documents with the fastest bitrate possible without knowing the behavior of the client.
You will find 3 codes for 3 servers acting differently according to the chosen client ( C language ).
You have a presentation that explain our scientifical approach in order to determine the best parameters.
